# Geography of Accessibility with GIS-based Network Analysis
This is the website I designed for the final project of my group (consisting of Bella Leo, Tan Jia En, and myself, Jules Robins)
in fulfillment of Singapore Management University's SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning AY22/23 T1 requirements.
Specifically, we explored the equity of access to Junior Colleges in Singapore using the QGIS platform to analyse geospatial data.
