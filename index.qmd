Welcome to our GIS Project website!

The theme of the project is Geography of Accessibility with GIS-based Network Analysis, specifically regarding the impact of closures or mergers of Junior Colleges in Singapore on equity of access. Everyone has the right to education and we believe post-secondary education should be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.
